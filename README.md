# TheCatGame
My complete Cat-themed platformer, filled with traditional and experimental platforming mechanics!
This game is split into two segments, one traditional platforming section with a beautiful landscape and basic gravity and platforming mechanics including slipper-slopes and wall-jumping, and a space-themed segment with planetery spherical and rectangular gravty mechanics, as well as alternate platforming mechanics such as levitation zones and bounce pads.
Every asset except for the skybox in the first area was made by me, including the modelling, animation, and shader graph work!
